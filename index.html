                <p>
                    Greetings all! My name is Gavin Perkins, and I am a fourth-year student at Northeastern University studying Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Data Science. I am passionate about renewable energy, sustainability, and biotechnology. Some of my hobbies include traveling, watching movies, and photography! I have created this website to share my research publications, thoughts on current events, and life updates. Prior to my senior year of college, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to intern at the Electric Power Research Institute, working in hydropower and aquatic resource protection. This experience catalyzed my interest in the energy field. Additionally, I feel as though I can make the most impact and create a sustainable world through the field of renewable energy. The goal of this website is to share research advances in the field of energy, as well as inspire others to interact with and learn more about all renewable energy has to offer.
