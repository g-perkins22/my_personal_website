                    Some facts about hydropower:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hydropower is one of the oldest sources of energy</li>
                    <li>Hydropower accounts for about 16% of the world's total electricity production</li>
                    <li>Pumped storage hydropower stores energy by pumping water uphill and releasing it for power generation when energy demand is high</li>
                    <li>Dams can block fish migration patterns (especially salmon) necessitating the recent invention of fish ladders</li>

                <h3>About Fish Ladders</h3>
                <p>
                    Fish ladders are structures that allow fish to migrate upstream and reach spawning areas. This is common for fishes such as salmon as they consistently move upstream to reproduce, meaning they exhibit anadromous migration. Fish ladders provide a series of small steps for fish to gradually swim up and over a hydroelectric dam. The water flows through the ladder in a way that mimics water currents, allowing for easy passage. The different types of fish ladders include: pool and weir, denil, fish elevators, and vertical slots. Fish ladders help preserve river biodiversity, support commerical fisheries, and greatly improve ecosystem health.
